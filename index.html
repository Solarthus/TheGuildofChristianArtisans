                    <p>Larry McGraw is the founder of The Guild of Christian Artisans, a Christian nonprofit dedicated to discipling artisans and students through craftsmanship, mentorship, and service under the Lordship of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                    <p>His vision for the Guild is rooted in the biblical model of apprenticeship, where skill is passed through relationship, character is formed alongside competence, and labor is offered unto The LORD.</p>
					<p>He serves to guard the mission and shepherd the vision, ensuring that the Guild remains CHRIST-centered and church-connected. He believes that artisans who walk in obedience and skill can become quiet but powerful witnesses.</p>

                    <h3>Andrew Gratton</h3>
                    <span class="leader-title">Lead Artisan & Guild Treasurer</span>
                    <p>Andrew Gratton is a master artisan with over twenty years of experience in traditional blacksmithing and wood carving. His life’s work reflects a deep commitment to craftsmanship, patience, and the faithful stewardship of skill, formed through years of hands-on practice and disciplined labor.</p>
                    <p>With a deep conviction that work is worship, Andrew approaches craftsmanship not merely as a trade to be mastered, but as a calling to be stewarded faithfully before The LORD. His work reflects the biblical model of apprenticeship, where skill is refined through patience, character is shaped through responsibility, and craftsmanship becomes an offering unto GOD rather than a pursuit of profit alone.</p>
					<p>Andrew is committed to passing on both technical skill and spiritual integrity, believing that artisans who labor in obedience to CHRIST can serve as quiet but powerful witnesses in their families, churches, and communities. Through his mentorship and hands-on instruction, he seeks to cultivate excellence, humility, and faithfulness in the next generation of craftsmen.</p>
